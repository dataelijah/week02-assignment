  ###*I achieved several a number of meaningful media query so that there are noticeable changes between mobile and desktop view. Some of my take on this was to reposition the responsive thumbnail icons, and also at the mobile phone level, the colour theme changed further.

###Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:
###I found this project very enlightening and very challenging.
###From utilising the video and media website recommended by Manny to eventually manupulating the @media query responsiveness.
###There are things I want to know in relation to grid and flexbox and how to really force items to stay in place, especially with changing screens. I also wish to be much more prominent in Javascript. This is currently my hardest part and I'm excited in learning more.

#Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission:
###I will like to understand more about the full capabilities of @media query, and how to manupulate simple items to fit;
###There were a few things I couldn't help but had myself stuck on for hours, such as: 1. Attempting to rotate media 90degrees with a screen change of max-width: 1232px for example. Javascript, a 'best practice' way on the use of Grid and flexbox also.

###Furthermore, I wished I touched more on Aria-label/live, as I have limited understand on how to apply it; although I understand fully well it's uses. I had such limited time with family-life balance. However I stretched onto completing some srcset; although I have a feeling that I may not have utilised it
###I ensured to achieve all requirements. However, I found the assignment challenging and difficult at times, as I try to push myself to learn and research, there were a lot of trial and error, and had to research very specifically at individual elements in aim to fit my particular design approach. It was a learning curve and a very enjoyable one.

#What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
###MDN, BrowserStacks, Stackoverflow, and some forums I google on while trying to achieve certain looks and objects.

#What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
###@Media query was one of my biggest struggle.
###I also still struggle with JS languaging but this will come in time I believe.
There were also issues with certain styling limitation that took me a while to research on how to overcome it. Borders, overflows and boundaries.

#What went really well and what could have gone better?
###I enjoyed the whole process, however I need to learn to manage my time better and perhaps as I progress, I believe a more progressive work approach for me would be to keep some templates handy which willhelp me have a basic set-up handy; as at the moment I still haven't been able to memorise all code and lines, but I am getting to understand the languaging and syntaxes better.
